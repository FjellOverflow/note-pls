# Deprecation notice

This project is no longer updated or maintained.

## Background

The intention behind this project was to have the option of quickly adding tasks or thoughts to a notes file. I am using Obsidian for my notes and quickly sending a message in Telegram was easier than opening the Obsidian mobile app (long startup time), opening the correct note and adding text at the bottom.

## Alternatives

For people using this bot for a similar purpose to mine, I can recommend replacements.

### Obsidian Telegram Inbox

The [obsidian-telegram-inbox](https://github.com/icealtria/obsidian-telegram-inbox) plugin offers near identical functionality to this project.

### Automate

I have recently discovered the [Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate/) app, which allows you to create a smooth and nice quick caption flow that adds new tasks to your Obsidian notes. That, or similar Android apps, allow powerful and adaptable shortcuts, achieving the same as this project.
